# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
**Overview**

The Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition on Kaggle is an introductory challenge for machine learning. The objective is to predict whether a passenger survived or not on the Titanic based on various features like age, sex, class, and other attributes.

**Problem**

Given a dataset with passenger information, the task is to build a model that predicts survival based on attributes such as:

Name, age, sex, class, and ticket details
Whether traveling alone or with family
The port from which they boarded

**Approach**

**Data Exploration:** Analyze the dataset to understand the features and identify any missing or incorrect data.

**Data Preprocessing:** Clean the data by handling missing values, converting categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

**Model Building:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) using the training data.

**Prediction:** Use the trained model to predict the survival status for the test dataset.

**Submission:** Submit predictions on Kaggle for evaluation.

**Tools & Libraries**

Python 3

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn
